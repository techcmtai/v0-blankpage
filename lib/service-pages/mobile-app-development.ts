      question: "How long does it take to develop a mobile app?",
      answer:
        "The timeline for mobile app development varies depending on the complexity and requirements of the project. A simple app might take 2-3 months, while a complex application could take 4-6 months or more. We'll provide you with a detailed timeline during the planning phase.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between native and cross-platform development?",
      answer:
        "Native development involves building separate apps for each platform (iOS and Android) using platform-specific languages and tools. Cross-platform development uses frameworks like React Native or Flutter to build a single codebase that works on multiple platforms. Native apps typically offer better performance and access to platform features, while cross-platform apps are more cost-effective and faster to develop.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to develop a mobile app?",
      answer:
        "The cost of mobile app development depends on various factors including complexity, features, platforms, and design requirements. Simple apps might start at $20,000-$50,000, while complex apps with advanced features can cost $100,000 or more. We provide detailed cost estimates based on your specific requirements.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you help with app store submission?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we handle the entire app store submission process for both Apple App Store and Google Play Store. We ensure your app meets all the guidelines and requirements for a smooth approval process.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you update my existing mobile app?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we can update, enhance, or redesign your existing mobile application. We'll start by analyzing your current app and then recommend improvements based on user feedback, performance metrics, and the latest industry trends.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure app security?",
      answer:
        "We implement various security measures including secure authentication, data encryption, secure API communication, protection against common vulnerabilities, and compliance with platform-specific security guidelines. We also perform security testing throughout the development process.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my app work offline?",
      answer:
        "We can design your app with offline functionality that allows users to access certain features and data without an internet connection. When the connection is restored, the app can sync data with the server automatically.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide app analytics?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we integrate analytics tools like Firebase, Mixpanel, or Google Analytics to track user behavior, app performance, and other key metrics. These insights help you make data-driven decisions to improve your app over time.",
