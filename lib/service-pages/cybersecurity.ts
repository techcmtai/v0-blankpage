      question: "What cybersecurity services do you offer for small businesses?",
      answer:
        "For small businesses, we offer right-sized security solutions including vulnerability assessments, basic security policies, endpoint protection, email security, data backup solutions, security awareness training, and incident response planning. We focus on implementing essential security controls that provide maximum protection within budget constraints, addressing the most common threats small businesses face.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you help organizations comply with security regulations?",
      answer:
        "We assist with regulatory compliance by first identifying which regulations apply to your organization (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc.). We then conduct gap assessments against these requirements, implement necessary controls and documentation, prepare for audits, and establish ongoing compliance monitoring. Our approach integrates compliance into your overall security program rather than treating it as a separate checkbox exercise.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's your approach to employee security awareness training?",
      answer:
        "Our security awareness training combines engaging content, practical exercises, and simulated phishing to build a security-conscious culture. We customize training based on your industry, specific threats, and employee roles. We also implement regular reinforcement through newsletters, posters, and micro-learning. We measure effectiveness through behavioral metrics and adjust the program accordingly.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle security incidents?",
      answer:
        "Our incident response follows a structured methodology: identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. We establish clear roles and communication channels, preserve evidence properly, and work to minimize both immediate impact and recovery time. After resolution, we conduct thorough post-incident analysis to prevent similar incidents and strengthen your security posture.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of penetration testing do you perform?",
      answer:
        "We conduct various types of penetration testing including network penetration testing, web application testing, mobile application testing, cloud infrastructure testing, social engineering assessments, and red team exercises. Our approach combines automated tools with manual testing by experienced ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities that automated scans might miss.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you secure cloud environments?",
      answer:
        "Our cloud security approach includes secure architecture design, identity and access management, data protection, network security, continuous monitoring, and automated compliance checks. We have expertise across major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) and implement cloud-native security tools along with third-party solutions to create defense-in-depth protection for your cloud resources.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's your approach to data protection?",
      answer:
        "We implement comprehensive data protection through data classification, encryption (both at rest and in transit), access controls, data loss prevention, secure backup solutions, and data retention policies. We focus on understanding your sensitive data flows and implementing appropriate controls at each stage of the data lifecycle, from creation to deletion.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer ongoing security monitoring services?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we provide continuous security monitoring services including real-time threat detection, log analysis, behavioral monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and security alert investigation.
