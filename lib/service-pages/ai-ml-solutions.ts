      question: "What types of business problems can AI/ML solve?",
      answer:
        "AI and machine learning can address a wide range of business challenges including predictive maintenance, fraud detection, customer segmentation, demand forecasting, recommendation systems, process automation, quality control, customer service automation, risk assessment, and personalization. The key is having sufficient quality data related to the problem you're trying to solve.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much data do we need to implement an AI solution?",
      answer:
        "The amount of data required depends on the complexity of the problem and the type of AI solution. Some solutions may work with hundreds of examples, while others might require millions. More important than quantity is data quality, relevance, and diversity. During our initial assessment, we'll evaluate your data and advise on whether it's sufficient or if additional data collection is needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to develop an AI/ML solution?",
      answer:
        "Development timelines vary based on project complexity, data readiness, and integration requirements. Simple AI projects might take 2-3 months, while complex enterprise solutions could take 6-12 months. We provide detailed timelines during the planning phase after assessing your specific requirements and data situation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure the accuracy and reliability of AI models?",
      answer:
        "We employ rigorous validation techniques including cross-validation, A/B testing, and continuous monitoring. Our process includes extensive testing with diverse datasets, regular retraining with new data, and implementing feedback loops for ongoing improvement. We also establish clear performance metrics aligned with your business objectives to measure success.",
