    {
      question: "How long does it take to develop custom software?",
      answer:
        "Development timelines vary based on the complexity and scope of the project. Simple applications might take 3-6 months, while complex enterprise systems could take 9-18 months or more. We use an agile approach that delivers functional components incrementally, allowing you to start using parts of the system before the entire project is complete.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does custom software development cost?",
      answer:
        "The cost depends on various factors including complexity, features, integrations, and user experience requirements. Simple applications might start at $50,000-$100,000, while enterprise-level systems can range from $150,000 to $500,000+. We provide detailed estimates after thoroughly understanding your requirements and can work with you to prioritize features based on your budget.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need custom software or would an off-the-shelf solution work?",
      answer:
        "This depends on your specific needs. Off-the-shelf software works well for standard business processes that don't require customization. Custom software is ideal when you have unique processes, need specific integrations with other systems, want a competitive advantage, or when existing solutions don't meet your requirements. We can help evaluate your needs and recommend the best approach.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who owns the intellectual property rights to the software?",
      answer:
        "In most cases, you (the client) own the intellectual property rights to the custom software we develop for you. This includes source code, designs, and documentation. We may use certain proprietary frameworks or components, but the application-specific code and functionality belong to you. This is clearly outlined in our contracts.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure the security of custom software?",
      answer:
        "Security is integrated throughout our development process. We implement secure coding practices, conduct regular security code reviews, perform vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, and follow industry security standards. We also implement appropriate authentication, authorization, encryption, and data protection measures based on your security requirements.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you integrate with our existing systems?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we specialize in creating software that integrates seamlessly with your existing systems. We have experience with various integration methods including APIs, webhooks, database integration, file transfers, and middleware solutions. During the discovery phase, we'll analyze your current systems and design appropriate integration strategies.",
    },
    {
      question: "What technologies do you use for custom software development?",
      answer:
        "We select technologies based on your specific requirements rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. We have expertise in various programming languages (Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc.), frameworks (Spring, .NET, React, Angular, etc.), and database systems (SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.). We'll recommend the best technology stack for your project based on requirements, performance needs, and long-term maintainability.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of support do you provide after the software is launched?",
      answer:
        "We offer various support options including bug fixes, security updates, performance optimization, feature enhancements, and user support. We can provide training for your staff, comprehensive documentation, and knowledge transfer. We also offer maintenance packages with different service levels based on your needs and response time requirements.",
